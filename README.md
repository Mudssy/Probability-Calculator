# Probability Calculator
# Overview
Probability Calculator is a website that allows users to calculate probabilities and conditional probabilities using probabilities given by the user. It is coded in pure JavaScript and hosted at [probability-calculator.net](probability-calculator.net).

# Usage
Go to probability-calculator.net in your web browser.
Enter the probability values in the provided input fields.

Click the "Calculate" button.
The website will display the calculated probability or conditional probability in the result section.

# Features
* Calculate the probability of events.
* Show which formulas were used to get the probabilities.

# How it works
The website uses the basic probability formulas and Bayes' theorem to calculate the probabilities and conditional probabilities. When the user inputs the probability values and events, the website applies the appropriate formula to calculate the probability or conditional probability and displays the result.
